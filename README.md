## Svelte Connect4 Demo

- this project was done as part of my **CSDS221** course for extra credit
- it was part of my efforts to learn svelte. I have used svelte previously for a messenger proof of concept, **Spyder messenger** but was no where near an expert so I decided to continue learning with this app. 

### running the application

- a demo version of the app can be found [here](cademichael.github.io/public/index.html)
- to run the app locally 
  - clone the repo
  - cd into the directory
  - run `npm install`
  - run `npm run dev`
  - then the game should be running on *localhost:8080*
